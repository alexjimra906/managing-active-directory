# Setting Up a Domain Controller in Azure

## Overview
This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of setting up a domain controller (DC) and client machine in Microsoft Azure. The lab covers creating resources, configuring networking, and ensuring proper communication between the domain controller and client.

---

## Environments and Technologies Used
- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Windows Active Directory Domain Services

## Operating Systems Used
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10

## List of Prerequisites
- An active Microsoft Azure subscription
- Basic knowledge of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Familiarity with virtual networking in Azure
- Windows Server administration skills
- The ability to set static IPs and DNS settings in Azure

## Step 1: Setting Up the Domain Controller (DC-1)

### Tasks Performed:
1. **Create a Resource Group:** 
   - Established a resource group to organize all related resources.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Network and Subnet:**
   - Configured networking to allow communication between the DC and other machines.

3. **Create the Domain Controller VM:**
   - **Operating System:** Windows Server 2022  
   - **VM Name:** `DC-1`  
   - **Credentials:**
     - Username: `labuser`
     - Password: `Cyberlab123!`
   - Configured the NIC private IP address to be static for consistency.

4. **Disable Windows Firewall:**
   - Temporarily disabled the firewall to test connectivity.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Client Machine (Client-1)

### Tasks Performed:
1. **Create the Client VM:**
   - **Operating System:** Windows 10  
   - **VM Name:** `Client-1`  
   - **Credentials:**
     - Username: `labuser`
     - Password: `Cyberlab123!`
   - Connected to the same region and Virtual Network as `DC-1`.
     
2. **Configure DNS Settings:**
   - Updated Client-1's DNS settings to point to `DC-1â€™s Private IP`.

   - Restarted Client-1 to apply changes.
3. **Test Connectivity:**
   - Verified the client could ping the DC-1 private IP address successfully.

   - Ensured DNS settings were correctly updated by running `ipconfig /all`.

## Final Steps

1. **VM Preservation:**
   - The VMs were left intact for use in future labs. For cost-saving purposes, the VMs were stopped within the Azure portal when not in use.
2. **Future Scope:**
   - This setup lays the groundwork for additional Active Directory-related tasks, such as user management and group policies.
